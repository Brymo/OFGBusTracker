# OFGBusTracker

Kids were panicking wondering whether their bus was going to show up at OFG or whether they were going to be stuck at school for the weekend.  This project aims to use NSW's trip planner API to poll live bus data so that students know that they're going to be able to sleep in their own beds after school.
